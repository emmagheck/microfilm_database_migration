# Microfilm Accessions Migration Script
This Python script migrates microfilm-only accession records from a Microsoft Access export (in XML format) to a CSV file formatted for import into ArchivesSpace.
It filters and transforms relevant data fields from the XML export, applies consistent data mapping and formatting, and outputs a ready-to-import CSV using a provided ArchivesSpace CSV template.
